# odin-pcg-rand

An implementation of [PCG random number generation](https://www.pcg-random.org/), in a package for Odin.

The source includes an example in main.odin and the package itself. Run build.sh to build the entire project, or just build-lib.sh (in the package) to build the library for your platform. Building the library will require gcc.
